    To persist data from the game, like user level, score, etc.
    No particular security is applied for the moment,
    so a simple edit of this file will impact the game (cheating is easy).
    We don't care too much for the moment since this game is under construction.
    
    In the future, we could make things more secured by using Hash algorithms and inter-dependant checksums on every blocks.
    Modifying manually a value would break the checksums consistency.
    We could as well remove the file extension, zip the file etc. to make hackers life a bit harder :-)
