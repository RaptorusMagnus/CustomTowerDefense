# CustomTowerDefense
A tower defense game (**Currently under construction**) built with the famous MonoGame framework.

Like many many people, I decided to learn the MonoGame framework be designing a simple game.
So here is "yet another" learning project.
However, since I had quite some experience in standard business C# coding, I tried to build a nice architecture.

This project was designed with the following goals in mind:
* Keep a clean architecture to allow the game to grow in the future
* Allow custom level building with an external descriptive text file (json or xml)
* A lot of comments to remember what I had learned, and to help other newbies
