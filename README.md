# CustomTowerDefense
A tower defense game (**Currently under construction**) built with the famous MonoGame framework.

Like many people, I decided to learn the MonoGame framework by designing a game of my own.
So here is "yet another" learning project.
However, since I had quite some experience in standard business C# coding, I headed for a not so simple first try, and I tried to build a nice evolutive architecture.

This project was designed with the following goals in mind:
* Stay humble, because I'm not a game programmer, and it is a very specific skill to aquire.
* Keep a clean architecture to allow the game to grow in the future.
* Leave a lot of comments to remember what I had learned, and to help other newbies.
* Build a game that is actually fun to play, not just a single level demo.
* Try to go further than the existing (2021) MonoGame tower defense projects, to bring a real added value.

Required features (Not yet done)
* Allow custom level building with an external descriptive text file (json or xml).

## Tutorials used to learn and build this game
When starting from scratch, I found it usefull to watch relatively short videos, or read short articles to build a very little (but functional), game in few minutes/hours.
But, the main problem is that short and simple introductions, tend to give poor architectures. I ended up refactoring my code several times to reach the actual version and I wasted quite some time.
I would therefore recommend to **avoid the apparently easy way, and start with a structure that matches your expectations**. If you want to design a real game, and not a simple demo, go for longer tutorials, and spend more time analysing real existing open source games.
